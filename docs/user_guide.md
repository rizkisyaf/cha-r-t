# cha(r)t User Guide

This guide will help you get started with cha(r)t, an AI-powered financial charting and analysis platform.

## Getting Started

After installing and running the application (see the main README.md for installation instructions), you'll be presented with the main interface:

![cha(r)t Interface](interface.png)

The interface consists of several key components:

1. **Header**: Contains the logo, current symbol, search bar, and user actions
2. **Sidebar**: Quick access to different chart types and tools
3. **Chart Area**: The main financial chart with price and volume data
4. **Chat Panel**: Where you interact with the AI assistant

## Interacting with the AI Assistant

The AI assistant can help you analyze financial data, modify charts, and build trading strategies. Here are some examples of what you can ask:

### Chart Modifications

- "Add a 50-day simple moving average"
- "Show the RSI indicator"
- "Draw a trend line from the March low to the current price"
- "Add Bollinger Bands with 20 periods and 2 standard deviations"
- "Remove the MACD indicator"

### Analysis Requests

- "What's the current market trend?"
- "Identify key support and resistance levels"
- "Calculate the average volume over the last 30 days"
- "Is this stock overbought or oversold?"
- "Compare the performance with the S&P 500"

### Strategy Building

- "Create a strategy to buy when RSI is below 30 and sell when it's above 70"
- "Backtest a golden cross strategy on this chart"
- "Alert me when the price breaks above the 200-day moving average"
- "Set up a notification for when volume spikes more than 50% above average"

## Chart Controls

### Timeframes

You can change the timeframe of the chart by clicking on the timeframe buttons in the chart header:
- 1m: 1 minute
- 5m: 5 minutes
- 15m: 15 minutes
- 30m: 30 minutes
- 1h: 1 hour
- 4h: 4 hours
- 1D: 1 day
- 1W: 1 week
- 1M: 1 month

### Chart Tools

The chart header also contains tools for:
- Drawing tools: Lines, rectangles, Fibonacci retracements, etc.
- Indicators: Technical indicators like moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.
- Text annotations: Add notes to the chart
- Save chart: Save the current chart configuration
- Screenshot: Take a screenshot of the chart

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: When asking the AI to add indicators or draw patterns, be specific about parameters (e.g., "Add a 20-day SMA" rather than just "Add a moving average").

2. **Provide Context**: If you're asking for analysis, provide context about what you're looking for (e.g., "Analyze the recent price action for potential reversal patterns").

3. **One Request at a Time**: For best results, make one request at a time rather than asking for multiple actions in a single message.

4. **Use Natural Language**: You don't need to use specific commands - just ask in natural language, and the AI will understand.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Refresh the Page**: If the chart doesn't load or update properly, try refreshing the page.

2. **Check Connection**: Ensure your internet connection is stable, as the application requires connectivity for AI and data services.

3. **API Limits**: If you're seeing errors about data not loading, you might have reached API rate limits. Wait a few minutes and try again.

4. **Clear Cache**: If you experience persistent issues, try clearing your browser cache and reloading.
